This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The project was an assessment to test for skills and proficiency in nextjs. The end result had to be similar to a design in canvas.(https://www.figma.com/file/e7y9pBrpHcPWfUvDx9PTX8/DiploAI---take-home-assessment---
